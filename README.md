## About

This assignment is about creating an entire webpage just from the image of a design provided, which makes students start from a black HTML & CSS document.<br>
I had so much fun creating everything by my own for the first time! <br>
Now I understand more clearly about concepts of semantic HTML and CSS flexbox.<br>
